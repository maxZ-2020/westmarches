# Session Logs

Every Session gets its own Log. In this Log it is recorded which NPC gave/got which Information from Whom.

# Threads

Every Quest Like Thingy gets its own Log where the Progress is recorded.

# Every Note has a Session Log

The state of an Entity is tracked on a per Session basis. When the Entity is altered for the first time during that Session the Inventory/State is Copied and then subsequently altered.
Keeping Track of everything is kind of time consuming. Inventories and Locations of NPCs/Items are Important and Quick to manage. An Item should only be a Note if it is a unique Item.

Items that belong to the Player are Tracked by the Player.
If they leave them in a special Place then a reference is recorded there so things can get stolen if need be.

# Maps

When the spatial relationship of Entities are Important it is recorded in a Canvas.
If the Entity has a Note the note is attached to the Canvas.
