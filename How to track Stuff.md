# Every Note has a Session Log

The state of an Entity is tracked on a per Session basis. When the Entity is altered for the first time during that Session the Inventory/State is Copied and then subsequently altered.
Keeping Track of everything is kind of time consuming. Inventories and Locations of NPCs/Items are Important and Quick to manage.
